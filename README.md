# PostFix Calculator
__This is my third and final project for CSC 1254.__

_This calculator calculates arithmatic sequences in postfix notation._

# How to use
* This code works with user input. However, it needs to end its sequence with 'p'
* Example Input: 2 2 + p 
  * => 4
* This calculator uses operations ... 
  * add
  * subtract
  * increment
  * decrement
  * multiply
  * integer division
  * multi add (first value is how many numbers you want to add)
  * powers
  * factorial
  * modulo
  * absolute value 

_Note: some html sequences can be printed incorrectly._
    
    ex. decrement (--) can be read as one long character, depending where you may be copying and pasting a sequence from.
