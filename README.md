# Fizz Buzz
__This was my first programming project for CSC 1254, an data structures and algorithms focused course.__
_Note: this course is not the official data structures and algorithms course offered at LSU. Later projects posted will demonstrate the focus of the course._

The purpose of this program was to demonstrate the simplicity of some popular interview questions, such as the Fizz Buzz question. The try / catch statement was the only implementation of new information. Which proved superior to while loops when error checking. 

## How to use

__Input__ 
* max; highest value to iterate through
* step; the incrementer of iteration
* the first divisor
* the second divisor 
  
  Note: there is a case for the value 42 as a divisor. This was a specific constraint implemented by the professor.
